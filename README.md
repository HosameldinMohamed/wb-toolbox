### A Simulink Toolbox for Whole-Body Control

This toolbox allows non-programming experts and researchers approaching _Whole-Body Control_ to more easily develop controllers on either simulated or real `YARP`-based robotic platforms.<br>
Develop to deployment time is minimized by exploiting the rich variety of Simulink's toolboxes and its capabilities on rapid prototyping and visual debugging.

`WBT` is based on the dataflow framework [`blockfactory`](https://github.com/robotology/blockfactory). Visit the [Whole-Body Toolbox Website](https://robotology.github.io/wb-toolbox/) for more information.

## Who uses `WBT`

`WBT` is used extensively in the controllers stored in [robotology/whole-body-controllers](https://github.com/robotology/whole-body-controllers).

This video shows the latest results on the iCub robot achieved in the EU project CoDyCo in which a top level controller implemented with the `WBT` achieves a running `100 Hz` rate.
